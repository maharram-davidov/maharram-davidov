## 🧠 About Me
I am a Computer Science student focused on **building and integrating applied AI systems**.  
My work emphasizes **problem formulation, data preparation, model experimentation, and system-level integration**, using modern AI tools to rapidly prototype and validate ideas.

Rather than low-level algorithm development, I focus on:
- Designing end-to-end ML pipelines
- Iterating on model behavior and evaluation
- Integrating ML models into real-world systems (APIs, bots)
- Understanding system limitations and improving reliability

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
- **Programming:** Python (reading, modifying, and running ML-based systems)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, basic NLP, model evaluation
- **Backend / Systems:** FastAPI, REST APIs
- **Data:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Tools:** Git, Linux
- **Applied Tools:** OCR (EasyOCR), Telegram Bots, Networking fundamentals
